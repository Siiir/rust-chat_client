Shows to user chat messages pulled from server. Can also post a new message. Has quite efficient implementation of pinging (listening for) new messages that might have been posted.

**chat_client** is **loosly coupled** with **chat server** implementations like [java-ChatServer](https://github.com/Siiir/java-ChatServer) (as of time of writing it's the only implementation).
